# 226. Invert Binary Tree [easy]     
Invert a binary tree.    

Example:     
```
Input:

     4
   /   \
  2     7
 / \   / \
1   3 6   9

Output:
     4
   /   \
  7     2
 / \   / \
9   6 3   1
```

Trivia:
This problem was inspired by this original tweet by Max Howell:      
Google: 90% of our engineers use the software you wrote (Homebrew), but you canâ€™t invert a binary tree on a whiteboard so f*** off.   

## Solution     
### Recursive DFS       
```
 public TreeNode invertTree(TreeNode root) {
        if (root == null) {
            return null;
        }
        
        final TreeNode left = root.left;
        final TreeNode right = root.right;
        
        root.left = invertTree(right);
        root.right = invertTree(left);
        return root;
    }
```
