# Leetcode about Tree.       
Inorder: left, root, right       
Preorder: root, left, right    
Postorder: left, right, root     

## Recursive    
private helper() function   


## Iterative    
Always we need a Stack (FILO) for storing temporary element, add element ```stack.push()```, get element out ```stack.pop()```, see the top element ```stack.peek()```, check size of stack ```stack.size()```    
Also we always need ```while(node != null || !stack.isEmpty())``` for a iterate loop
