# 34. Find First and Last Position of Element in Sorted Array [medium]     
Given an array of integers nums sorted in ascending order, find the starting and ending position of a given target value.    
Your algorithm's runtime complexity must be in the order of O(log n).     
If the target is not found in the array, return [-1, -1].     

Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [5,7,7,8,8,10], target = 8
Output: [3,4]
```
Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [5,7,7,8,8,10], target = 6
Output: [-1,-1]
```
Constraints:     
```
0 <= nums.length <= 10^5
-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9
nums is a non decreasing array.
-10^9 <= target <= 10^9
```

## Solution     
### Initial idea 
My initial idea is that find one target value with Binary Search. Then based on +1/-1 index to find same value.    
However, it will get TLE.      

### 2 BS   
There must be two indices in the array. Which means, we can just simply apply to binary search twice to find each index of the target element.
