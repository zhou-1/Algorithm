# 108. Convert Sorted Array to Binary Search Tree [easy]     
Given an array where elements are sorted in ascending order, convert it to a height balanced BST.     
For this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differ by more than 1.     

Example:     
Given the sorted array: [-10,-3,0,5,9],     
One possible answer is: [0,-3,9,-10,null,5], which represents the following height balanced BST:      
```
      0
     / \
   -3   9
   /   /
 -10  5
 ```

## Solution     
### Recursion    
I get overflow problems at first because I didn't use mid - 1 and mid + 1 as the bound.      
Time complexity: O(N) since we visit each node exactly once.     
The space is O(logn) since there are at most logn recursion stacks in the meantime.    
```
class Solution {
    public TreeNode sortedArrayToBST(int[] nums) {
        if (nums == null || nums.length == 0){
            return null;
        }
        
        int size = nums.length;
        TreeNode node = helper(nums, 0, size-1);
        
        return node;
    }
    
    private TreeNode helper(int[] nums, int low, int high){
        if (low > high){
            return null;
        }
        
        //int mid = (low + high) / 2; // get middle index
        int mid = low + (high-low)/2; // avoids integer overflow     
        TreeNode node = new TreeNode(nums[mid]); //nums[mid]: middle element
        
        node.left = helper(nums, low, mid-1);
        node.right = helper(nums, mid + 1, high);
        
        return node;
    }
}
```
