# 111. Minimum Depth of Binary Tree [easy]     
Given a binary tree, find its minimum depth.     
The minimum depth is the number of nodes along the shortest path from the root node down to the nearest leaf node.       

Note: A leaf is a node with no children.      

Example:    
Given binary tree [3,9,20,null,null,15,7],     
```
    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7
return its minimum depth = 2.
```

## Solution     
### BFS      
BFS is much better here, rather than a DFS approach.     
If you have a tree where say the root's left subtree has a depth of 500 and the right subtree has a depth of 1, the code is going to traverse all the way down the 500 left subtree first before finally traversing the right subtree with a measly depth of 1 and figuring out "d'oh!" that's the min depth.     
With BFS, instead of traversing 501 nodes to figure out the min depth, you could've just traversed two. Now imagine if the left subtree comprised of tens of thousands of nodes      


### DFS    
```
class Solution {
    public int minDepth(TreeNode root) {
        // prepare for final result
        int res = 0;
        
        // check for extreme condition; this one can be ignored here
        if(root == null){
            return res;
        }
        
        res = helper(root);
        return res;
    }
    
    private int helper(TreeNode node){
        if (node == null)	return 0;
        
        if (node.left == null)	return helper(node.right) + 1;
	    if (node.right == null) return helper(node.left) + 1;
        
        return Math.min(helper(node.left),helper(node.right)) + 1;
    }
}
```
