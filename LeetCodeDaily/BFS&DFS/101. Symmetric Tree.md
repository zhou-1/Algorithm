# 101. Symmetric Tree [easy]     
Given a binary tree, check whether it is a mirror of itself (ie, symmetric around its center).      

For example, this binary tree [1,2,2,3,4,4,3] is symmetric:     
    1    
   / \   
  2   2   
 / \ / \   
3  4 4  3    
 

But the following [1,2,2,null,3,null,3] is not:    
    1    
   / \   
  2   2   
   \   \   
   3    3   
 
Note:    
Bonus points if you could solve it both recursively and iteratively.     

## Solution     

### 1. Recursion    
Make root node be 2 root nodes. Then the question will be similar to 100. same tree.  
Only one difference: compare with one node.left and another node.right; one node.right and another node.left.      

```
class Solution {
    public boolean isSymmetric(TreeNode root) {
        return helper(root, root);
    }
    
    public boolean helper(TreeNode n1, TreeNode n2){
        if(n1 == null && n2 == null) return true;
        
        if(n1 == null || n2 == null) return false;
        
        if(n1.val != n2.val) return false;
        
        return helper(n1.left, n2.right) && helper(n1.right, n2.left);
        
        // last two lines can be aslo use below sentence to replace:
        /*
        return (t1.val == t2.val)
            && isMirror(t1.right, t2.left)
            && isMirror(t1.left, t2.right);
        */
        
    }
    
}
```
Time complexity : O(n). Because we traverse the entire input tree once, the total run time is O(n), where nn is the total number of nodes in the tree.       
Space complexity : The number of recursive calls is bound by the height of the tree. In the worst case, the tree is linear and the height is in O(n). Therefore, space complexity due to recursive calls on the stack is O(n) in the worst case.     

### 2. Iterative    
Instead of recursion, we can also use iteration with the aid of a queue. Each two consecutive nodes in the queue should be equal, and their subtrees a mirror of each other. Initially, the queue contains root and root. Then the algorithm works similarly to BFS, with some key differences. Each time, two nodes are extracted and their values compared. Then, the right and left children of the two nodes are inserted in the queue in opposite order. The algorithm is done when either the queue is empty, or we detect that the tree is not symmetric (i.e. we pull out two consecutive nodes from the queue that are unequal).      

```
class Solution {
    public boolean isSymmetric(TreeNode root) {
        // check for extreme condition
        if(root == null){
            return true;
        }
        
        // create a queue to store nodes
        Queue<TreeNode> q = new LinkedList<> ();
        q.add(root);
        q.add(root);
        
        while(!q.isEmpty() ){
            TreeNode n1 = q.poll();
            TreeNode n2 = q.poll();
            
            if(n1 == null && n2 == null) continue;
            if(n1 == null || n2 == null) return false;
            if(n1.val != n2.val) return false;
            
            q.add(n1.left);
            q.add(n2.right);
            q.add(n1.right);
            q.add(n2.left);
            
        }
        
        return true;
        
    }
}
```

Time complexity : O(n). Because we traverse the entire input tree once, the total run time is O(n), where nn is the total number of nodes in the tree.     
Space complexity : There is additional space required for the search queue. In the worst case, we have to insert O(n) nodes in the queue. Therefore, space complexity is O(n).
