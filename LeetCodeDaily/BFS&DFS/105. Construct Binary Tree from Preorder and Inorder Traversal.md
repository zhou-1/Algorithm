# 105. Construct Binary Tree from Preorder and Inorder Traversal [medium]       
Given preorder and inorder traversal of a tree, construct the binary tree.     
Note:   
You may assume that duplicates do not exist in the tree.     

For example, given    
preorder = [3,9,20,15,7]   
inorder = [9,3,15,20,7]    
Return the following binary tree:     
    3    
   / \   
  9  20   
    /  \   
   15   7    


## Solution     

The basic idea is here:   
Say we have 2 arrays, PRE and IN.    
Preorder traversing implies that PRE[0] is the root node.   
Then we can find this PRE[0] in IN, say it's IN[5].   
Now we know that IN[5] is root, so we know that IN[0] - IN[4] is on the left side, IN[6] to the end is on the right side.    
Recursively doing this on subarrays, we can build a tree out of it :)
