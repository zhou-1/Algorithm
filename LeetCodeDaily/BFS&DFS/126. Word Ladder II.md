# 126. Word Ladder II [hard]     
Given two words (beginWord and endWord), and a dictionary's word list, find all shortest transformation sequence(s) from beginWord to endWord, such that:      
Only one letter can be changed at a time     
Each transformed word must exist in the word list. Note that beginWord is not a transformed word.    
  
Note:    
Return an empty list if there is no such transformation sequence.    
All words have the same length.    
All words contain only lowercase alphabetic characters.    
You may assume no duplicates in the word list.    
You may assume beginWord and endWord are non-empty and are not the same.     

Example 1:   
```
Input:
beginWord = "hit",
endWord = "cog",
wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log","cog"]

Output:
[
  ["hit","hot","dot","dog","cog"],
  ["hit","hot","lot","log","cog"]
]
```

Example 2:
```
Input:
beginWord = "hit"
endWord = "cog"
wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log"]

Output: []
Explanation: The endWord "cog" is not in wordList, therefore no possible transformation.
```

## Solution     
The basic idea is:      
1). Use BFS to find the shortest distance between start and end, tracing the distance of crossing nodes from start node to end node, and store node's next level neighbors to HashMap;      
2). Use DFS to output paths with the same distance as the shortest distance from distance HashMap: compare if the distance of the next level node equals the distance of the current node + 1.
