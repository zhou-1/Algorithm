# 133. Clone Graph [medium]     
Given a reference of a node in a connected undirected graph.    
Return a deep copy (clone) of the graph.      

Each node in the graph contains a val (int) and a list (List[Node]) of its neighbors.       
```
class Node {
    public int val;
    public List<Node> neighbors;
}
```

Test case format:      
For simplicity sake, each node's value is the same as the node's index (1-indexed). For example, the first node with val = 1, the second node with val = 2, and so on. The graph is represented in the test case using an adjacency list.      
Adjacency list is a collection of unordered lists used to represent a finite graph. Each list describes the set of neighbors of a node in the graph.      
The given node will always be the first node with val = 1. You must return the copy of the given node as a reference to the cloned graph.   

## Solution     
### Depth First Search     
HashMap for node's value and node itself as map's key and value.      
node's neighbor information has already existed.     


```
class Solution {
    // create a HashMap
    private Map<Integer, Node> map = new HashMap<> ();
    
    public Node cloneGraph(Node node) {
        return helper(node);
    }
    
    private Node helper(Node node){
        if(node == null) return null;
        
        if(map.containsKey(node.val)){
            return map.get(node.val);
        }
        
        Node clone = new Node(node.val);
        map.put(clone.val, clone);
        
        for(Node neighbour : node.neighbors){
            clone.neighbors.add(helper(neighbour));
        }
        
        return clone;
    }
    
}

```

### iterative BFS solution with HashMap and queue     
Use HashMap to look up nodes and add connection to them while performing BFS.     

```
public Node cloneGraph(Node node) {
    if (node == null) return null;

    // **new node to return
    // MUST BE DEFINED OUTSIDE SO THAT IT CAN BE RETURNED
    Node newNode = new Node(node.val, new ArrayList<>());
    // store visited nodes
    // key is the ORIGINAL node, value is the NEW node
    HashMap<Node, Node> map = new HashMap();
    // add starting node to HashMap
    map.put(node, newNode);

    // store ORIGINAL nodes to be visited in a queue
    Queue<Node> queue = new LinkedList();
    // add the start node to the queue
    queue.add(node);
    //if more nodes need to be visited
    while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
        //search neighbors of top node in the queue
        Node polledOrigNode = queue.poll();

        // if node 1 has neighbors 2 and 3
        for (Node origNeighbor : polledOrigNode.neighbors) {
            // if the map does not contain the neighbor that means
            // the node needs to be cloned and added to map
            // check if map contains 2 then 3
            if (!map.containsKey(origNeighbor)) {
                // if map does not contain 2 or 3 create a clone 2c, 3c
                Node newNeighborNode = new Node(origNeighbor.val, new ArrayList<>());
                // add 2,2c to map and 3,3c
                map.put(origNeighbor, newNeighborNode);
                // add 2,3 to queue
                queue.add(origNeighbor);
            }
            // get the cloned node of the original node
            // add the new neighbor to the cloned nodes neighbor list
            // get 1c from map to its neighbors, add 2c and 3c
            map.get(polledOrigNode).neighbors.add(map.get(origNeighbor));
        }
    }

    return newNode;
}
```
