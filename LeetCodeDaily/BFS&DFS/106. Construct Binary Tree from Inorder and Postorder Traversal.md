# 106. Construct Binary Tree from Inorder and Postorder Traversal [medium]     
Given inorder and postorder traversal of a tree, construct the binary tree.     

Note:   
You may assume that duplicates do not exist in the tree.    

For example, given    
inorder = [9,3,15,20,7]    
postorder = [9,15,7,20,3]    

Return the following binary tree:       
    3   
   / \   
  9  20   
    /  \   
   15   7   


## Solution     
inorder: left, root, right     
postorder: left, right, root     
The the basic idea is to take the last element in postorder array as the root, find the position of the root in the inorder array.    
Then locate the range for left sub-tree and right sub-tree and do recursion. Use a HashMap to record the index of root in the inorder array.   

### Recursive    
HashMap, key: value of the element in inorder, value: index of that element.       

is - start index for inorder array    
ie - end index for inorder array     
ps - start index for postorder array     
pe - end index for postorder array      

Remember :      
InOrder is (left subtree) node (right subtree)     
PostOrder is (left subtree)(right subtree) (node)     
From post order array we get the root which will be at index pe     
while from in order we can get the number of children in the left subtree ie. ri-is          
(is, ri-1) and (ri+1, ie) should be straightforward because these are indices for left and right subtrees in the inorder traversal.    
(ps, ps+ri-is-1) and (ps+ri-is, pe-1) these are indices for left and right subtrees in the postorder traversal. the trick is that no matter what which traversal is used, the number of nodes in the subtrees remain the same. so if in the inorder traversal the length of left subarray is 3, this length is also the same as that for postorder traversal       

Time complexity: O(n)     
Space complexity: O(n)

class Solution {
    public TreeNode buildTree(int[] inorder, int[] postorder) {
        // check for extreme case
        if(inorder == null || postorder == null || inorder.length != postorder.length){
            return null;
        }
        // create a HashMap for value and index
        HashMap<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        for(int i = 0; i < inorder.length; i++ ){
            map.put(inorder[i], i);
        }
        
        return helper(inorder, 0, inorder.length-1, postorder, 0, postorder.length-1, map);
        
    }
    
    // helper function for get the root
    private TreeNode helper(int[] inorder, int is, int ie, int[] postorder, int ps, int pe, 
                                 HashMap<Integer,Integer> map){
        // check for extreme condition
        if(is > ie || ps > pe){
            return null;
        }
        
        // get current root
        TreeNode root = new TreeNode(postorder[pe]);
        
        // get index of the element
        int ri = map.get(postorder[pe]);
        
        TreeNode leftchild = helper(inorder, is, ri-1, postorder, ps, ps+ri-is-1, map);
	    TreeNode rightchild = helper(inorder,ri+1, ie, postorder, ps+ri-is, pe-1, map);
	    
        root.left = leftchild;
	    root.right = rightchild;
	    
        return root;
        
        
    }
    
}
```

### Iteration    
This is my iterative solution, think about "Constructing Binary Tree from inorder and preorder array", the idea is quite similar. Instead of scanning the preorder array from beginning to end and using inorder array as a kind of mark, in this question, the key point is to scanning the postorder array from end to beginning and also use inorder array from end to beginning as a mark because the logic is more clear in this way.     
The core idea is: Starting from the last element of the postorder and inorder array, we put elements from postorder array to a stack and each one is the right child of the last one until an element in postorder array is equal to the element on the inorder array. Then, we pop as many as elements we can from the stack and decrease the mark in inorder array until the peek() element is not equal to the mark value or the stack is empty. Then, the new element that we are gonna scan from postorder array is the left child of the last element we have popped out from the stack.      

```
public TreeNode buildTree(int[] inorder, int[] postorder) {
    if (inorder.length == 0 || postorder.length == 0) return null;
    int ip = inorder.length - 1;
    int pp = postorder.length - 1;
    
    Stack<TreeNode> stack = new Stack<TreeNode>();
    TreeNode prev = null;
    TreeNode root = new TreeNode(postorder[pp]);
    stack.push(root);
    pp--;
    
    while (pp >= 0) {
        while (!stack.isEmpty() && stack.peek().val == inorder[ip]) {
            prev = stack.pop();
            ip--;
        }
        TreeNode newNode = new TreeNode(postorder[pp]);
        if (prev != null) {
            prev.left = newNode;
        } else if (!stack.isEmpty()) {
            TreeNode currTop = stack.peek();
            currTop.right = newNode;
        }
        stack.push(newNode);
        prev = null;
        pp--;
    }
    
    return root;
}
```
