# 106. Construct Binary Tree from Inorder and Postorder Traversal [medium]     
Given inorder and postorder traversal of a tree, construct the binary tree.     

Note:   
You may assume that duplicates do not exist in the tree.    

For example, given    
inorder = [9,3,15,20,7]    
postorder = [9,15,7,20,3]    

Return the following binary tree:       
    3   
   / \   
  9  20   
    /  \   
   15   7   


## Solution     
The the basic idea is to take the last element in postorder array as the root, find the position of the root in the inorder array; then locate the range for left sub-tree and right sub-tree and do recursion. Use a HashMap to record the index of root in the inorder array.
