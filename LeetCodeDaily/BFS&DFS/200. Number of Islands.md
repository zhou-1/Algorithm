# 200. Number of Islands [medium]     
Given a 2d grid map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), count the number of islands. An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.     

Example 1:    
```
Input:
11110
11010
11000
00000

Output: 1
```

Example 2:
```
Input:
11000
11000
00100
00011

Output: 3
```

## Solution     

### Find every island    
Find every island, one by one.     
If it is part of island, make it 0.... until find this island's boundary.       

```
class Solution {
    int x, y; //width and height of given grid
    char[][] g;     // The given grid, stored to reduce recursion memory usage
    
    public int numIslands(char[][] grid) {
        // prepare for final answer
        int res = 0;
        
        // check for extreme condition
        if(grid == null || grid.length == 0){
            return res;
        }
        
        // update info of grid
        g = grid;
        y = g.length; 
        x = g[0].length;
        
        // iterate over the entire grid
        // i for height; j for width
        for(int i = 0; i < y; i++){
            for(int j = 0; j < x; j++){
                if(g[i][j] == '1'){
                    helper(i,j); //helper method to dfs from this place of grid
                    res++;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return res;
    }
    
    // dfs method
    private void helper(int i, int j){
        // check for invalid indices or not
        // AND check for it is 1 or not; if it is not 1, done, return!
        if(i < 0 || i >= y || j < 0 || j >= x || g[i][j] != '1' ) return;
        
        // mark this place as visited
        g[i][j] = '0';
        
        // check all 4 neighbors
        helper(i+1, j);
        helper(i-1, j);
        helper(i, j+1);
        helper(i, j-1);
        
    }
    
}
