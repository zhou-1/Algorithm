<strong>Path sum Series</strong>        
I. Given a binary tree and a sum, determine if the tree has a root-to-leaf path such that adding up all the values along the path equals the given sum.      
Recursion and Non-recursion (stack, pre-order)     


<strong> Minimum depth of binary tree</strong>    
Recursion (DFS for left child and right child); Level order traversal (BFS and Queue<TreeNode> )
