## 5. Longest Palindromic Substring    
Given a string s, return the longest palindromic substring in s.

Example 1:     
Input: s = "babad"    
Output: "bab"      
Note: "aba" is also a valid answer.     

Example 2:    
Input: s = "cbbd"    
Output: "bb"     

Example 3:    
Input: s = "a"    
Output: "a"     

Example 4:      
Input: s = "ac"    
Output: "a"     

Constraints:     
1 <= s.length <= 1000     
s consist of only digits and English letters (lower-case and/or upper-case)      

## Answer    
### 1.Dynamic Programming     
If we already knew that "bab" is a palindrome, it is obvious that "ababa" must be a palindrome since the two left and right end letters are the same.     
Define p(i,j) = true (if substring si...sj is a palindrome) OR false (otherwise)     
p(i,j) = p(i+1, j-1) and si == sj. Base cases are: p(i,j)=true, p(i, i+1)=(si==si+1)    
```
